streams:
    formatted I/O   
    unformatted I/O fgets()

Input Streams:
    end of file marker

Stream management:
    fopen() opens a connection between program and streams
    fclose() closes

Formatted I/O:
    fscanf():
        reads data from a stream into variables according to a format string
    fprintf():
        writes data to a stream from variables according to format string
    
    *both functions call fread() or fwrite() [unformatted]

    fgets() and fread():
        both functions read data from a stream into one program variables
    
    fwrite():
        this writes data to a stream from one variable

files are 1d array of bytes

end of file marker:
    follows the last byte of the file
    feof - file end of file

file pointer:
    curr pos in the stream 
    where the next bvyte we will read or write from
