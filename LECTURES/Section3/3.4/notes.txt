no dummy nodes

we will make a Nodetype Struct that has
 Node next;
 (whatever type) data;

 ex:

 typedef struct Student {
  char name[MAX_STR];
  char major[MAX_STR];
} StudentType;

typedef struct Node{
    StudentType *data;
    struct Node *next;
} NodeType;


our list is basically;

NodeType* head --> NodeType
