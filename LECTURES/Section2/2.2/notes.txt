stack overflow error issue is because we are accessing array out of bounds

in c, it does not check for out of bounds error in arrays, meaing
char array[5];

calling
array[5] will still work, but it messes up our memory.

capacity -> max amount of itmes allowed in arrray
size -> how many current items in array.

compiler error -> gcc cant compile code
runtime error -> we can compile code and get a.out, but when we run the output file, it crashes.


sizeof return the number of bytes.
    -> 1 int = 4 bytes
    -> 1 char = 1 byte



Strings Slides:
strings are arrays of char,

they must be terminated by the NULL character

printf and scanf are variadic functions, they can take a non-fixed number of arguments

in c, strings are passed by refference always.

value 0 is null character, but '\0' is a char of the value 0. just like how '\n' is new line, there is a value behind it. 'J' == 73 i think?

myStr[3] = 0; //same as myStr[3] = '\0'
